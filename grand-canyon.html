                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Grand Canyon was formed over millions of years through the erosion caused by the Colorado River.
                    It has been inhabited by Native American tribes for thousands of years. The canyon was first
                    encountered by Europeans in the 16th century when Spanish explorers visited the area. It became a
                    national park in 1919, thanks to the efforts of conservationists like Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
                <p>Throughout its history, the Grand Canyon has been a site of exploration and scientific discovery.
                    Geologists have studied its rock layers to understand the Earth's history, while adventurers have
                    navigated the Colorado River's challenging rapids. The park also played a role in the development of
                    the American conservation movement. The establishment of the Grand Canyon National Park marked a
                    significant milestone in preserving natural wonders for future generations.</p>
